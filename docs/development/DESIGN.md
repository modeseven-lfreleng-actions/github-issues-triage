# Design: Scheduled AI Triage of GitHub Issues

**Status:** Draft
**Repository:** `lfreleng-actions/github-issues-triage`
**Author:** Matthew Watkins (AI-drafted, human-reviewed)
**Last updated:** 2026-08-17

## 1. Problem Statement

Open issues across the `lfreleng-actions` organisation routinely sit
unlabelled. The daily report produced by
[`github-security-report-action`](https://github.com/lfreleng-actions/github-security-report-action)
surfaces this as the **Untriaged** column of its GitHub Issues table —
at one recent count, 25 of 37 open issues carried no labels at all.
Unlabelled issues do not appear in release-drafter categories, evade
maintainers' label filters, and skew the org's backlog-hygiene signal.

Manual triage works (a one-off AI-assisted pass cleared the backlog in
August 2026) but does not stay done. New issues arrive daily; the org
needs a recurring, automated triage pass.

## 2. Goal

A scheduled GitHub Actions workflow in this repository that:

1. Runs at **07:00 UTC every weekday** (`cron: '0 7 * * 1-5'`)
2. Scans **all open issues across the `lfreleng-actions` org**
3. Drives an agent harness running **Anthropic Claude Opus 5**
4. Applies labels per the org's canonical taxonomy (see §6)
5. Reports what it did (step summary, and optionally Slack)

Closing the loop: `github-security-report-action` *surfaces* the
untriaged backlog; this pipeline *clears* it. Together the Untriaged
column should trend to zero and stay there.

### Non-goals (initial release)

- Closing, reopening, or commenting on issues
- Editing issue titles or bodies
- Assigning issues to people or milestones
- Triage of pull requests (the PR autolabeler in
  `lfreleng-actions/.github` already covers those)
- Creating labels that do not already exist in a repository

Each of these is a possible later phase, gated behind explicit
configuration, but the initial release applies labels and nothing
else: labels are low-risk, reversible, and auditable.

## 3. Model Access: Copilot vs. Anthropic API

Two candidate routes to Claude models existed at design time; one
was viable then. GitHub has since shipped the route the other
assessment ruled out — see §13.

### 3.1 GitHub Copilot subscription — superseded ⚠️

The original assessment recorded here: the org-level Copilot
subscription exposes Anthropic models **within Copilot surfaces**
(IDE chat, Copilot CLI, the Copilot coding agent) and nowhere
else. There is no general-purpose API entitlement, and no
supported harness exists for "run Claude Code against the Copilot
backend". GitHub Models (the `models` permission on
`GITHUB_TOKEN`) offers API access to a catalogue of models, but
Anthropic models are not part of that catalogue and its rate
limits target experimentation, not production batch jobs.

Most of that still holds: no general-purpose API entitlement
exists, and GitHub Models remains the wrong tool. The conclusion
drawn from it does not. Copilot CLI now carries a supported
**programmatic mode** and documented GitHub Actions integration,
which makes the Copilot surface itself a usable harness rather
than a dead end. Section 13 records the third engine that follows
from it.

### 3.2 Anthropic API key — recommended ✅

The org holds paid Anthropic subscriptions and can issue API keys. The
official [`anthropics/claude-code-action`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action)
accepts an `anthropic_api_key` input and runs Claude Code
non-interactively against a prompt. This is Anthropic's supported path
for CI automation.

- Secret: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, stored as a **repository Actions
  secret** on this repository (not org-wide — no other pipeline needs
  it, and scoping narrowly limits blast radius). If the org later
  standardises on 1Password retrieval
  (`1password-secrets-action` / `credential-load-action`), migration
  is a two-line change.
- Recommended hygiene: a **dedicated Anthropic workspace** for this
  pipeline so spend is attributable and capped, and the key is
  rotatable without touching other consumers.

An alternative — authenticating Claude Code with a Claude Pro/Max
subscription OAuth token (`claude_code_oauth_token`) — works with
the action but ties the pipeline to an individual's subscription and
its consumer rate limits. Not appropriate for org infrastructure.

## 4. Agent Harness

### 4.1 Options considered

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

| Option | Verdict |
| ------ | ------- |
| `anthropics/claude-code-action` (official) | ✅ **Selected** |
| Bespoke script calling the Messages API | ❌ Re-implements tool-use loop, retries, context mgmt |
| Copilot coding agent | ❌ Repo-scoped, PR-oriented, wrong shape; the CLI is the usable Copilot surface (§13) |
| Self-hosted agent framework | ❌ Heavyweight; nothing to gain over Claude Code here |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

`claude-code-action` runs Claude Code in "agent mode" when given a
`prompt` input: no human in the loop, tool use (including `gh` via
Bash) available, and `claude_args` passes through CLI arguments such
as `--model` and `--allowedTools`.

### 4.2 Invocation sketch

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@<commit-sha>  # vX.Y.Z
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    github_token: ${{ steps.app-token.outputs.token }}
    prompt: ${{ steps.build-prompt.outputs.prompt }}
    claude_args: >-
      --model claude-opus-5
      --max-turns 80
      --allowedTools "Bash(gh issue list:*),Bash(gh issue view:*),
      Bash(gh issue edit:*),Bash(gh label list:*),
      Bash(gh search issues:*)"
```

Notes:

- **Pin by commit SHA** (org rule: never bare version tags, never tag
  object SHAs). Resolve the SHA at implementation time.
- **Model identifier**: confirm the exact API model string for Opus 5
  (`claude-opus-5-…`) against the Anthropic model list when
  implementing; treat it as a workflow-level `env` value so bumps are
  one-line changes.
- **Tool allow-list is the primary containment**: the agent gets
  read/label verbs of `gh` and nothing more — no `git`, no file
  writes that matter, no arbitrary shell. Even a fully confused agent
  cannot close issues, comment, or push code, because the token (§5)
  and the tool list both forbid it.
- `--max-turns` bounds runaway loops; the job also carries a
  `timeout-minutes` ceiling (suggest 30).

### 4.3 Cost control

Opus-class models are expensive. Two mitigations:

1. **Pre-filter before invoking the model.** A cheap `gh search
   issues --owner lfreleng-actions --state open` step lists unlabelled
   issues first. If there are none (the steady state), the workflow
   **skips the model call entirely** — a daily no-op costs one API-free
   minute of runner time.
2. **Batch, don't fan out.** One agent session triages all pending
   issues in a single run rather than one session per issue. Volume is
   modest (tens of issues at worst after a weekend).

A weekday 07:00 UTC schedule (rather than daily) matches the ask and
avoids paying for weekend runs into an empty queue.

## 5. GitHub Authentication and Permissions

The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` covers this repository alone; the
pipeline must label issues **org-wide**, so it will not suffice.

### 5.1 Recommended: the existing org bot GitHub App

The org already operates a bot App (used in `test-release-process` via
`vars.LF_RELENG_BOT_CLIENT_ID` / `secrets.LF_RELENG_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY`).
Reuse it — or, if its installation permissions are broader than
needed, create a sibling `lf-releng-triage` App. Requirements:

- **Permissions:** `issues: write`, `metadata: read` — nothing else
- **Installation:** all repositories in `lfreleng-actions`
- **Token minting in-workflow:**

```yaml
- uses: actions/create-github-app-token@<commit-sha>  # vX.Y.Z
  id: app-token
  with:
    client-id: ${{ vars.LF_RELENG_BOT_CLIENT_ID }}
    private-key: ${{ secrets.LF_RELENG_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY }}
    owner: lfreleng-actions
    permission-issues: write
    permission-metadata: read
```

The `permission-*` inputs down-scope the minted token even if the App
itself holds more, and the token expires after one hour — well inside
the job timeout. App-authored label events also carry attribution
in each issue's timeline (`lf-releng-bot` avatar), which
matters for auditability.

### 5.2 Rejected: fine-grained PAT

A PAT bound to a human account works but rots when that human leaves,
is harder to down-scope per-run, and attributes bot actions to a
person. Treat it as a stopgap if App reuse stalls.

## 6. Triage Policy (the prompt's contract)

The label taxonomy is **already canonical** in the org: the PR
autolabeler in `.github/.github/release-drafter.yml` maps Conventional
Commit types to labels, and the August 2026 manual triage pass applied
the same scheme to issues. The agent must follow it, not invent one.

| Label | Apply when the issue… |
| ----- | --------------------- |
| `bug` | reports incorrect behaviour |
| `feature` | requests new capability (replaces retired `enhancement`) |
| `documentation` | concerns docs/README/CONTRIBUTING content |
| `code-quality` | concerns linting, typing, test coverage, hygiene |
| `CI` | concerns workflows, runners, pre-commit infrastructure |
| `chore` | tracks maintenance (archival, dep housekeeping) |
| `refactor` | requests restructuring without behaviour change |
| `breaking-change` | describes/implies a compatibility break |
| `performance` | concerns speed or resource use |

Hard rules encoded in the prompt:

1. **Add existing labels, nothing else**
   (`gh label list` first; never create labels).
2. **One-to-two labels per issue** — a primary category, plus at most
   one secondary (e.g. `bug,code-quality` for a broken linter config).
3. **Never remove labels a human applied**, with one standing
   exception: migrate `enhancement` → `feature` (org convention).
4. **Skip issues that already have labels** unless run with the
   `retriage` input (see §7).
5. **When genuinely uncertain, apply `question`** rather than
   guessing a category — that label *is* the "needs human" signal.
6. Report every action taken (and every skip, with reason) in a final
   summary written to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`.

The report's own classification
(`github-security-report-action`'s `DEFAULT_ISSUE_LABELS`) buckets
`bug|defect` → Bug, `feature|enhancement` → Feature,
`documentation|docs` → Docs; the remaining labels above land in the
report's Other column. That is fine — Other means "labelled, but not
Bug/Feature/Docs", a healthy state.

The prompt lives in the repository as `prompt/triage.md` (versioned,
reviewable, diffable); the workflow loads it at run time rather than
inlining it in YAML.

## 7. Workflow Design

The job below lives in the **reusable** workflow
(`issues-triage.yaml`); the scheduled caller
(`issues-triage-cron.yaml`) contributes the triggers and org
secrets. See §7.3 for the split.

```text
Triggers (caller):
  schedule: '0 7 * * 1-5'      # 07:00 UTC, Mon-Fri
  workflow_dispatch:            # manual runs
    inputs:
      retriage:  boolean, default false   # re-examine labelled issues
      dry_run:   boolean, default false   # report, apply nothing
      repository: string, optional        # limit scope to one repo

Jobs:
  scan (ubuntu-latest, timeout-minutes: 30)
    permissions: {}             # job-level; App token carries the writes
    steps:
      1. harden-runner-block-action  -> loads org egress allow-list
      2. step-security/harden-runner -> egress-policy: block
      3. actions/create-github-app-token -> issues:write org token
      4. checkout (this repo, for the prompt file)
      5. snapshot (before): dump org-wide open-issue state to
         artefacts/before.json; derive unlabelled count
         -> if zero and !retriage: write summary, upload snapshot,
            exit success
      6. anthropics/claude-code-action -> the triage session
         (session transcript captured; see 7.2)
      7. snapshot (after): same dump to artefacts/after.json
      8. report: diff snapshots + parse transcript ->
         artefacts/triage-report.{json,md} and $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
      9. actions/upload-artifact (always(), even on failure)
     10. (optional) Slack notification via existing org mechanism
```

Design points:

- **`concurrency`**: `group: issues-triage, cancel-in-progress: false`
  — never let two triage sessions race; queue instead.
- **Note on schedule drift**: GitHub `schedule` events can fire late
  under load. 07:00 UTC is a target, not a guarantee; nothing in this
  design is time-critical.
- **Dry-run mode** maps to removing `gh issue edit` from
  `--allowedTools` and telling the agent to report intended labels
  without applying them. First week of operation should run dry with
  human review of the proposals.
- **Idempotence**: a re-run over an already-triaged org is a no-op by
  construction (step 5 short-circuits; rule 4 in §6 guards the rest).

### 7.1 Egress (harden-runner)

The org runs `step-security/harden-runner` in **block** mode, with
`harden-runner-block-action` loading the allow-list from the newest
tagged file in the `.github` special repository. The org allow-list
(`.github/harden-runner/lfreleng-actions/allow_list.txt`) contains
**no Anthropic endpoints** today. Required additions:

```text
api.anthropic.com:443
```

plus whatever telemetry/statsig endpoints the pinned Claude Code
release requires. The rollout sequence:

1. The reusable workflow exposes an `egress_policy` input
   (default `audit`), passed straight to harden-runner.
2. Initial scheduled runs use **audit** mode; the harden-runner
   report captures the agent session's outbound endpoints.
3. A PR against `lfreleng-actions/.github` adds those endpoints to
   the allow-list.
4. The org caller flips `egress_policy` to **block**, with
   `harden-runner-block-action` loading the updated tagged list.

Whether the endpoints belong in the shared
baseline or in a **supplemental per-repo allow-list** is the
question of [`lfreleng-actions/.github#161`](https://github.com/lfreleng-actions/.github/issues/161);
if that lands first, use it — an Anthropic API grant is a
single-consumer permission and should not be fleet-wide. Until then,
additions go to the shared list by PR against `lfreleng-actions/.github`.

### 7.2 Reporting and Run Artefacts

Every run must be fully reconstructable after the fact: what the org
looked like before, what the agent saw, what it decided and why, and
what the org looked like afterwards. Three mechanisms deliver this.

#### Before/after snapshots

Steps 5 and 7 dump the complete org-wide open-issue state (repo,
number, title, labels, timestamps) via a single `gh search issues
--json` call each, to `artefacts/before.json` and
`artefacts/after.json`. The snapshots serve two purposes:

1. The report step diffs them to compute **ground truth** for what
   changed — the summary reports observed label changes, not the
   agent's claims about what it did. Any divergence between the two
   (agent claims X, diff shows Y) is itself flagged in the summary.
2. They are cheap insurance: if a run ever needs reverting, the
   before-snapshot is the authoritative record of prior state.

#### Agent session transcript

The pipeline captures the **entire agent session** and attaches it to
the run, so we can debug the triage logic turn by turn:

- `claude-code-action` writes a structured execution log (JSON,
  turn-by-turn: prompts, tool calls, tool results, token usage) and
  exposes its path as a step output. The workflow copies that file to
  `artefacts/session-transcript.json` verbatim.
- The transcript also yields **cost telemetry** (turns used,
  input/output tokens, model id), which the report step folds into
  the step summary so spend per run is visible without opening the
  Anthropic console.

Transcript content is issue text from public repositories plus agent
reasoning — nothing sensitive by construction. Actions masks
registered secrets in logs, and the API key is never part of the
transcript. Should the org later point this pipeline at private
repositories, GitHub already restricts artefact access to users with
read access to this repository's Actions runs — but revisit the
decision then.

#### Artefact upload

A single `actions/upload-artifact` step (SHA-pinned) runs with
`if: always()` so failed or timed-out sessions still surface whatever
the run captured — the failure cases are precisely the ones needing
the transcript. The **agent step carries its own 20-minute timeout**
inside the job's 30-minute ceiling: a session that hits it fails that
step alone, leaving the evidence steps guaranteed time to run (a
job-level timeout would cancel `always()` steps too):

```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@<commit-sha>  # vX.Y.Z
  if: always()
  with:
    name: issues-triage-${{ github.run_id }}
    path: artefacts/
    retention-days: 90
    include-hidden-files: false
```

Contents:

| File | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `before.json` | Org issue state before the session |
| `after.json` | Org issue state after the session |
| `session-transcript.json` | Full structured agent session (debugging) |
| `prompt.md` | The exact assembled prompt the session received |
| `triage-report.json` | Machine-readable diff + per-issue actions |
| `triage-report.md` | The same report as rendered in the summary |

90-day retention (vs. the 30-day default) keeps a rolling quarter of
triage history for trend analysis and post-hoc debugging without
notable storage cost at these file sizes.

#### Step summary (`$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`)

The summary is the at-a-glance view; artefacts carry the detail. It
must show the **before/after** movement as well as the actions taken:

1. **Headline counts** — issues scanned / triaged / skipped / errors,
   turns and tokens used, dry-run flag.
2. **Before/after table** — per repository: open issues, untriaged
   before, untriaged after (mirroring the security report's Issues
   table, so the two documents read side by side).
3. **Actions table** — one row per touched issue: repo, issue link,
   labels before → labels after, one-line rationale quoted from the
   agent.
4. **Skips and errors** — every issue examined but left alone, with
   reason (already labelled / `question` applied / API error).
5. **Artefact pointer** — link to the run's artefact bundle.

- **On failure or non-empty run (optional, phase 2):** Slack message
  to the existing org channel using the org-wide Slack
  secrets/variables already consumed by `project-reporting-tool` and
  `github-security-report-action`.
- The next morning's security report independently verifies the
  outcome: its Untriaged column is the external metric of success.

### 7.3 Modular consumption (reusable workflow)

The pipeline splits into a **reusable workflow** carrying the whole
job, and a **thin scheduled caller** carrying org-specific choices.
This mirrors the `generic-workflows` pattern the org already uses,
and lets other organisations (or individuals) consume the pipeline
by supplying their own tokens — no fork required.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

| File | Role |
| ---- | ---- |
| `.github/workflows/issues-triage.yaml` | Reusable (`workflow_call`): the full triage job |
| `.github/workflows/issues-triage-cron.yaml` | Org caller: schedule, dispatch inputs, secrets |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Interface of the reusable workflow:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

| Input | Default | Purpose |
| ----- | ------- | ------- |
| `org` | (required) | GitHub organisation or user to triage |
| `engine` | `claude` | Agent engine: `claude`, `gemini`, or `copilot` |
| `model` | engine default | Model; empty resolves per engine (§12, §13) |
| `dry_run` | `true` | Report intended labels; apply nothing |
| `retriage` | `false` | Re-examine issues that carry labels |
| `skip_agent` | `false` | Plumbing test: skip the agent session (secretless) |
| `repository` | `''` | Restrict the scan to one repository |
| `exclude_repos` | `''` | Comma-separated repositories to skip |
| `max_turns` | `80` | Agent session turn ceiling (no effect on `copilot`, §13.2) |
| `egress_policy` | `audit` | harden-runner mode (`audit`/`block`) |
| `egress_allow_config` | `''` | `harden-runner-block-action` config coordinate (block mode) |
| `github_app_client_id` | `''` | App auth; empty limits runs to dry-run |
| `assets_repository` | this repo | Where to fetch the prompt and report script |
| `assets_ref` | called workflow's commit | Ref of `assets_repository` to fetch |

| Secret | Required | Purpose |
| ------ | -------- | ------- |
| `anthropic_api_key` | claude runs, unless `skip_agent` | Anthropic API authentication |
| `gemini_api_key` | gemini runs, unless `skip_agent` | Gemini API (AI Studio) authentication |
| `copilot_token` | copilot runs, unless `skip_agent` | Copilot model requests: caller `GITHUB_TOKEN` or a "Copilot Requests" PAT (§13.3) |
| `github_app_private_key` | no | Pairs with `github_app_client_id` |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Defaults favour safe onboarding: a first-time consumer gets a
dry-run in audit mode scoped by their own token. Without App
credentials the pipeline cannot write: the job's own token
carries `issues: read` for snapshots, and **live runs fail fast**
rather than spend an agent session discovering they cannot label.
Applying labels — in one repository or across an organisation —
needs the App (or a PAT passed as the private-key secret
alternative, discouraged per §5.2); single-repository runs scope
the App token to that repository at mint time.

## 8. Repository Layout

This repository started from `workflows-template`, which
targets *reusable-workflow* repositories. This pipeline is a **caller**
workflow, not a reusable one, so much of the skeleton does not apply.

### Keep (from `workflows-template`)

- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.gitlint`, `.yamllint`, `.editorconfig`,
  `.ruff.toml`, `.gitignore` — org-standard linting
- `.github/workflows/release.yaml` — **required**: promotes draft
  releases to full releases on tag push (thin caller for the
  `generic-workflows` release reusable)
- `.github/workflows/openssf-scorecard.yaml`, `release-drafter.yaml`,
  `clear-action-cache.yaml`
- `.github/actionlint.yaml`, `.github/dependabot.yml`
- `LICENSES/`, `SECURITY.md`

### Remove (template skeletons that do not apply)

- `.github/workflows/build-test.yaml`
- `.github/workflows/build-test-release.yaml`
- `.github/workflows/merge.yaml`
- `.github/workflows/testing.yaml` — the template version
  exercised the removed `build-test.yaml` skeleton; **replaced** by
  a triage-specific test. Pull request runs are **secretless**: a
  same-repository PR can alter the local reusable workflow, so PR
  checks skip the agent session (`skip_agent`) and prove the
  plumbing from the PR head with no secret in reach. The full
  agent dry-run runs from `workflow_dispatch`, a maintainer-
  triggered, trusted execution path.
- `examples/` (build-test-release / merge examples)
- `.readthedocs.yml` — the template's Read the Docs config assumed a
  Sphinx tree and an installable Python package, and this repository
  is neither; the documentation site builds with MkDocs and publishes
  to GitHub Pages instead

### Import from `actions-template`

- `.aislop/config.yml` — AI-slop scan configuration (workflows-template
  lacks it; this repo will carry a sizeable prompt document and the
  scanner needs configuring for it)
- `.github/workflows/tag-push.yaml` — tag-push automation, if we
  version/release this pipeline's prompt+workflow as a unit
- `README.md` structure as a reference for badge/header conventions
  (rewrite content for this repo)

### Add (new)

```text
docs/development/DESIGN.md                   # this document

README.md                                    # rewritten for this repo
```

## 9. Failure Modes and Mitigations

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

| Failure | Mitigation |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Anthropic API outage / 529s | Job fails visibly; next weekday run catches up. No retry storm: one run per day. |
| Agent mislabels an issue | Labels are reversible; step summary makes every action reviewable; humans can relabel (rule 3 stops the agent undoing them). |
| Agent goes off-script | `--allowedTools` denies every verb except issue reads plus a constrained label wrapper (validated repo/number/labels, org/repo scope and exclusion enforcement, pull requests rejected, `--add-label` and the coded enhancement migration, nothing else); `--max-turns` and step/job timeouts bound the session. |
| Prompt-injection via issue body | Real risk: issue text arrives as untrusted input. Containment as above — worst case within the sandbox is a wrong label on some issue, not code execution or data exfiltration (egress is allow-listed). Prompt instructs the agent to treat issue bodies as data, never as instructions. |
| Rate limits (GitHub) | ~120 open issues org-wide at worst; App tokens get 15k req/hr. Not a concern at this scale. |
| Cost runaway | Pre-scan short-circuit (§4.3), max-turns, weekday schedule, dedicated Anthropic workspace with a spend cap. |
| Secret leakage in logs | Actions masks registered secrets; Claude Code does not echo its key; harden-runner blocks unexpected egress. Transcript artefacts contain public issue text and nothing else (§7.2). |
| Session dies mid-run, no evidence | The agent step's own 20-minute timeout fails it inside the job ceiling; artefact upload runs `if: always()`, so snapshots and partial transcript survive. A missing after-snapshot renders the report "incomplete", never a fabricated zero diff. |
| Agent self-reports inaccurately | The report step builds the summary from the before/after snapshot diff, not the agent's claims, and flags divergence. |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

## 10. Open Questions

1. **App reuse vs. new App** — does `LF_RELENG_BOT` already have
   `issues: write` on all repos, and are we comfortable widening its
   use, or do we mint a dedicated `lf-releng-triage` App? (Owner:
   org admins.)
2. **Exact Opus 5 model string** — confirm against the live model
   catalogue at implementation time.
3. **Claude Code egress set** — harvest via an audit-mode run
   (§7.1).
4. **Slack in phase 1 or phase 2?** — the step summary may be enough
   given the security report already tells us daily whether the
   backlog is clear.
5. **Excluded repositories** — the security report excludes
   `project-reporting-artifacts`, `test-tags-calver`,
   `test-tags-semantic`; the triage prompt should honour the same
   exclusion list. Share it via a config file in this repo rather
   than hard-coding in the prompt.
6. **Transcript output contract** — resolved: `claude-code-action`
   v1 (verified at v1.0.193) exposes the structured execution log
   path as the `execution_file` output; the artefact step in §7.2
   consumes it.

## 11. Rollout Plan

1. **PR 1** — repo tidy-up: remove non-applicable template skeletons,
   import `actions-template` pieces, rewrite `README.md`, land this
   document.
2. **PR 2** — `prompt/triage.md` + `issues-triage.yaml` with the model
   step stubbed to dry-run; egress allow-list PR against
   `lfreleng-actions/.github` in parallel.
3. **Secrets** — create the Anthropic workspace + API key; add
   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` repo secret; confirm App variables/secrets are
   visible to this repo.
4. **Week 1** — scheduled dry-runs; human reviews the proposed labels
   each morning.
5. **Enable writes** — flip dry-run off; watch the security report's
   Untriaged column.
6. **Phase 2 (separate design discussion)** — Slack reporting,
   duplicate detection, stale-issue nudges, PR triage.

## 12. Second Engine: Google Gemini

**Status:** Implemented; resolved decisions recorded below.

IT direction steers most agentic work towards Google
Gemini, so the pipeline gains a second agent engine. The
architecture already isolates the provider: snapshots, exclusion
filtering, the policy prompt, the label wrapper, diff reporting,
and artefact capture are all engine-neutral. The agent session is
the single provider-specific step.

### 12.1 Engine selection

The reusable workflow gains an `engine` input (`claude` |
`gemini`, default `claude`), selecting between two mutually
exclusive agent-session steps. One reusable workflow, one
evidence pipeline, one policy prompt — two interchangeable
engines. A separate reusable per engine would duplicate the
evidence pipeline and let the copies drift; the single-workflow
design keeps every hardening decision (§5–§7) applying to both
engines by construction.

### 12.2 Gemini harness

[`google-github-actions/run-gemini-cli`](https://github.com/google-github-actions/run-gemini-cli)
(Google's official action, verified at v0.1.22) runs the Gemini
CLI non-interactively against a `prompt` input — the same shape as
`claude-code-action`. Key mappings:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

| Concern | Claude engine | Gemini engine |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Harness | `anthropics/claude-code-action` | `google-github-actions/run-gemini-cli` |
| Prompt | `prompt` input (assembled §6) | `prompt` input (same assembly, unchanged) |
| Model | `--model` via `claude_args` | `gemini_model` input |
| Tool containment | `--allowedTools` grant list | `settings` JSON: `tools.core` with `run_shell_command(...)` allow-list |
| Session transcript | `execution_file` output | `upload_artifacts` / CLI telemetry log (verify exact contract) |
| Turn ceiling | `--max-turns` | `model.maxSessionTurns` in settings JSON |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

The tool containment translates directly: the Gemini CLI's
`tools.core` allow-list grants specific shell commands, so the
Gemini session receives the same read verbs plus the same
constrained `apply-label.sh` wrapper in live mode — the wrapper's
scope/exclusion/PR-rejection enforcement is engine-independent by
design.

### 12.3 Authentication

Resolved: **`GEMINI_API_KEY`** (AI Studio), a repository secret
mirroring the Anthropic arrangement (§3.2). Vertex AI via
Workload Identity Federation (keyless OIDC) remains available as
a later increment — the harness supports it — without breaking
the interface.

The default Gemini model is **`gemini-3.5-flash-lite`** (IT
choice); the `model` input overrides it per run.

### 12.4 Work items

Delivered: the `engine` input with mutually exclusive agent
steps, the engine-aware key guard and model resolution, Gemini
`settings` assembly (`tools.core` allow-list,
`model.maxSessionTurns`, telemetry into the artefact directory),
session-summary capture,
and the `engine` choice on the manual dry-run dispatch and the
scheduled caller's dispatch. Scheduled runs went to the Copilot
engine instead (§13.6); Gemini stays a dispatch-time choice until
the org validates its output quality.

Remaining:

1. Transcript fidelity: confirm the Gemini telemetry log carries
   turn-by-turn content matching the §7.2 evidence guarantee, and
   map its cost/turn fields in `load_transcript_stats`
   (defensive parsing means unmapped fields drop out rather than
   break the report)
2. Egress: audit-mode Gemini run to harvest endpoints
   (`generativelanguage.googleapis.com:443` plus
   `registry.npmjs.org:443`, which the harness reaches to install
   the CLI) for the org
   allow-list, as §7.1 did for Anthropic
3. README consumption example for the Gemini engine

### 12.5 Open questions (Gemini track)

1. **Transcript fidelity** — does the Gemini CLI emit a
   turn-by-turn structured log matching what Claude Code's
   `execution_file` provides? The §7.2 evidence guarantee must
   hold for both engines.
2. **Billing ownership** — which GCP project/billing account
   carries the spend, and what is the Gemini analogue of the
   per-workspace spend cap?

## 13. Third Engine: GitHub Copilot

**Status:** Implemented and opt-in. The reusable workflow refuses
a live run on this engine, so it never applies labels, and that
stands until the command-level enforcement in §13.4 lands — see
the containment note in §13.2 for what that gap costs.

The organisation already pays for Copilot. A Copilot engine turns
triage spend into an existing entitlement rather than a third
vendor relationship, and removes a long-lived model API key from
the pipeline. Section 3.1 records why the original design ruled
Copilot out, and what changed since.

The engine slots into the existing abstraction (§12.1): a third
mutually exclusive agent-session step behind the same `engine`
input, sharing the snapshots, exclusion filtering, policy prompt,
label wrapper, diff report, and artefact bundle.

### 13.1 Harness options

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

| Option | Verdict |
| ------ | ------- |
| Copilot CLI programmatic mode (`copilot -p`) | ✅ **Selected** |
| [`github/gh-aw`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw) (GitHub Agentic Workflows) | ❌ Replaces this pipeline rather than plugging into it |
| A first-party Copilot CLI action | ❌ None exists |
| Copilot coding agent | ❌ Repo-scoped, PR-oriented, wrong shape |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

GitHub's own documentation recommends Agentic Workflows for most
automation, so the rejection needs justifying. `gh-aw` is a
compiler: it takes agentic workflows written as Markdown and
emits `.lock.yml` workflow files, carrying its own safe-output,
sandboxing, and permission models. Adopting it here would mean
re-authoring the pipeline in its idiom and displacing the parts
that stay engine-neutral and already carry review — the evidence
pipeline (§7.2), the label wrapper, the engine abstraction. That
makes it the right choice for a greenfield agentic workflow, not
for a third engine behind an established interface. Worth
revisiting if this pipeline is ever rebuilt from scratch.

No first-party action exists. Public workflows referencing
`github/copilot-cli-action` point at a repository that does not
exist. So the engine installs the CLI from npm at a pinned
version and invokes it directly, which is the pattern GitHub's
Actions documentation shows for direct use.

### 13.2 Mapping across the three engines

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

| Concern | Claude engine | Gemini engine | Copilot engine |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Harness | `anthropics/claude-code-action` | `google-github-actions/run-gemini-cli` | `copilot -p`, pinned npm install |
| Prompt | `prompt` input | `prompt` input | `--prompt`, read from `artefacts/prompt.md` |
| Model | `--model` via `claude_args` | `gemini_model` input | `--model` |
| Tool containment | `--allowedTools` grant list | `settings` JSON: `tools.core` | `--available-tools` and `--deny-tool` (enforced), `--allow-tool` (approval) |
| Repository credential | `GH_TOKEN` in the agent's environment | `GH_TOKEN` in the agent's environment | seeded `gh` config dir; absent from the agent's environment |
| Turn ceiling | `--max-turns` | `model.maxSessionTurns` | none — the step timeout bounds it |
| Session evidence | `execution_file` output | telemetry log plus summary output | `--log-dir` plus `--share` transcript |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Containment notes specific to this engine:

- **Approval versus enforcement.** `--allow-tool` is not the
  allow-list `--allowedTools` is on the Claude side. The CLI
  auto-approves shell commands it classifies as reads, so naming
  the `gh` groups pre-approves those without denying others.
  The engine layers three mechanisms in response:
  `--available-tools` restricts the model to the shell tools and
  nothing else, which the CLI enforces outright ("the model won't
  be able to use it at all"); `--deny-tool` blocks the mutating
  `gh` and `git` verbs, and outranks every allow rule and any
  approval the CLI would otherwise infer; `--allow-tool`
  pre-approves the groups the policy needs.

  What survives that stack is **other commands the CLI treats as
  reads**, which it auto-approves and no flag withdraws. A run
  confirmed the gap concretely: with no allow rule at all, `ls`
  and `cat` both ran, and `cat` returned a file's contents. (The
  same run showed `gh` sitting outside that classifier — the CLI
  refused an unapproved `gh label list` — so the gap covers
  ordinary shell reads, not the policy's own commands.)

  That matters more than "wider reads". The engine keeps both
  credentials out of the agent's *own* environment (see the
  redaction note below), which removes the easiest route to a
  token — a bare `$GH_TOKEN` expansion. It does not remove the
  general one. Shell commands run unsandboxed by default, as the
  same user as the CLI, so an auto-approved read reaches the
  parent process's environment: a run confirmed `ps eww -p $PPID`
  running without any allow rule and returning the CLI's full
  environment. Registered values come back masked, so the
  remaining step is a transformation — encoding the value —
  which redaction cannot follow.

  Two conclusions follow. Withholding a credential from the
  agent's shell is worth doing and is not a boundary. And the
  90-day evidence bundle holds whatever the session could reach,
  rather than whatever the run granted it.

  Writes remain shut regardless — the wrapper, the deny rules,
  and the token scope each enforce that independently — but this
  is a materially weaker boundary than the other two engines
  offer, and prompt-injected issue text is the threat it fails
  against. Closing it needs a `preToolUse` hook vetting each
  command against the commands the policy names (§13.4). Until
  that lands, the engine is opt-in, and the reusable workflow
  refuses live runs on it outright.
- **Shell pattern matching.** The CLI approves `gh` and `git`
  commands on their **first-level subcommand** alone. A run
  confirmed it: `shell(gh label:*)` matches
  `gh label list --repo …`, while `shell(gh label list:*)` matches
  nothing at all — the CLI refuses the command outright, and in
  `-p` mode a refused command cannot ask for approval. The same
  run showed **deny** rules matching at full-command granularity:
  `shell(gh issue edit:*)` blocks `gh issue edit …` even while
  `shell(gh issue:*)` allows the group.

  That asymmetry shapes the grant. Allow rules name the three
  first-level groups the policy needs — `gh search`, `gh issue`,
  `gh label` — and deny rules pare each group back to the verbs
  the policy actually uses. Mutating verbs go without saying
  (`gh issue edit`, `gh label create`). The non-issue searches
  are easier to miss: `gh search` covers `code`, `commits`,
  `prs` and `repos`, and `gh search code` would put repository
  content in front of the model and into a 90-day artefact. The
  engine still emits the bare and `:*` forms of each pattern,
  since the bare form covers a bare command and neither widens
  the grant.
- **Deny rules, and what they are worth.** They outrank every
  allow rule and any approval the CLI would otherwise infer, and
  they match further down the command than allow rules do. That
  makes them useful, and invites reading them as a
  command-level boundary. They are not one. Matching keys on the
  leading words of the command, and two valid `gh` spellings walk
  past it — both confirmed by run, against the production deny
  list:

  <!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

  | Command | Why it slips through |
  | ------- | -------------------- |
  | `gh issue new …` | `new` is an alias of `issue create`; the rule names `gh issue create` |
  | `gh issue -R o/r edit 1 …` | `-R` is a persistent flag on `gh issue`, so the command no longer begins `gh issue edit` |

  <!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

  The alias is now named in the list, but flag placement defeats
  **every** entry and no amount of enumeration fixes it: the
  agent may put any persistent flag ahead of any subcommand.

  So the deny list is defence in depth, and the real enforcement
  sits elsewhere: this engine runs with an `issues: read` App
  token and the workflow refuses live runs, so a bypassed rule
  reaches an API that rejects the write. That layering is why the
  gap costs nothing today — and why §13.4's command-vetting hook
  is a hard precondition for ever pairing this engine with a
  write-capable token, rather than an improvement to schedule
  later.
- **Token redaction, and the credential the agent never sees.**
  `--secret-env-vars` does two jobs, and the second one bites:
  it redacts the named variables' values from output **and**
  strips those variables from the environment of every shell the
  agent runs. A run confirmed the strip — a variable named there
  reads back unset inside an agent command, and the same variable
  reads back set when the flag omits it.

  So the flag cannot cover `GH_TOKEN`, which is where the
  repository credential lives: the agent's own `gh` commands
  would lose their authentication. The engine instead seeds a
  scratch `gh` configuration directory (`GH_CONFIG_DIR`, under
  the runner's temporary space) with the token before starting
  the session, and leaves `GH_TOKEN` in `--secret-env-vars`. The
  agent's `gh` works from the configuration file; the credential
  never appears in the agent's environment at all; and
  value-based redaction still covers it, because the CLI's own
  process keeps `GH_TOKEN` set — a run confirmed that a file
  holding the value comes back redacted when the agent reads it.

  That is an improvement on the other two engines here, and it
  delivers part of the alternative floated in §13.4: no
  credential sits in the agent's shell environment. It closes
  none of the gap above. The configuration file remains readable,
  and so does the CLI's own environment one process up — shell
  commands run unsandboxed as the same user, and a run confirmed
  an unapproved `ps eww -p $PPID` returning it. Redaction, not
  absence, is what protects the value at that point, and
  redaction follows values rather than intent.
- **Built-in MCP servers, disabled.** Copilot CLI ships a GitHub
  MCP server enabled by default, whose `label_write` tool would
  apply labels without passing through `apply-label.sh` — around
  the wrapper's scope, exclusion, and pull-request checks.
  `--disable-builtin-mcps` closes that route. Neither of the other
  two engines ships such a server, so this hardening has no
  analogue there.
- **Custom instructions, disabled.** The CLI merges `AGENTS.md`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
  from the working tree into its system prompt. The working tree
  holds the assets checkout, which on test runs comes from a pull
  request head. `--no-custom-instructions` leaves the policy
  prompt as the single instruction source.
- **No turn ceiling.** `max_turns` has no Copilot analogue;
  `--max-ai-credits` caps credits per response, a different unit,
  and makes no substitute. The agent step's 20-minute timeout
  bounds the session, inside the job's 30-minute ceiling.

### 13.3 Authentication and billing

Copilot CLI reads its credential from `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`,
then `GH_TOKEN`, then `GITHUB_TOKEN`. The engine sets the first
(model access) and the second (repository access) so the two
never mix. What the Copilot credential *can* reach depends on the
route. A PAT scoped to Copilot Requests reaches nothing but the
model. A caller `GITHUB_TOKEN` carries whatever its job grants,
so a caller that grants write hands write to the model credential
too; separating the two variables keeps the repository credential
out of the model path, it does not by itself bound the caller
token.

Two credentials work for the `copilot_token` secret today, and a
third remains a candidate (§13.6):

1. **The calling job's `GITHUB_TOKEN`**, where that job grants
   `copilot-requests: write`. No stored secret, a short-lived
   token per run, usage metered to the organisation. It depends
   on the organisation policy "Allow use of Copilot CLI billed to
   the organization", which GitHub enables by default wherever
   Copilot CLI is on.
2. **A fine-grained PAT** carrying the "Copilot Requests"
   permission. Works regardless of that policy, at the cost of a
   long-lived credential attributing spend to one person's seat.
   The permission sits under **Account permissions**, which
   GitHub offers when the token's resource owner is the user
   rather than an organisation. The CLI refuses classic PATs
   outright, whatever scopes they carry.

The CLI states its own supported list, worth quoting here
because it bounds what this pipeline may rely on. From
`copilot login --help` at 1.0.80:

> Supported token types include fine-grained personal access
> tokens (v2 PATs) with the "Copilot Requests" permission, OAuth
> tokens from the GitHub Copilot CLI app, and OAuth tokens from
> the GitHub CLI (gh) app.

App **installation** tokens (`ghs_`) are absent from that list.
GitHub does document installation tokens making Copilot requests
— "a service [that] needs to make Copilot requests on behalf of
an organization without a user's credentials" — but that page
covers the Copilot **SDK**, whose runtime is not this harness.
An earlier revision of this document said flatly that an
installation token *cannot* authenticate Copilot requests; a
later one said it can and named it the best credential here.
Both overreached. What holds is narrower: the capability exists
at the API, the CLI does not document it, and no run has tested
it. §13.6 tracks it as a candidate rather than a route.

The reusable workflow takes a **secret** rather than declaring
the permission itself, because a reusable-workflow chain can hold
or reduce permissions, never raise them. Declaring
`copilot-requests: write` on the triage job would fail every
existing caller, including callers that never touch this engine.
Passing the caller's token in as a secret leaves the permission
decision — and its failure mode — with the consumer that wants
the engine.

This repository's own callers use the PAT for now: neither the
pinned actionlint (1.7.12.24) nor the SchemaStore workflow schema
(check-jsonschema 0.38.0) recognises the `copilot-requests`
scope, so declaring it locally would fail the linting gate. That
blocks route 1 until both learn the scope.

One caveat on route 1. The secret's value comes from an
expression the **caller** evaluates, so it carries the caller
job's grant rather than the reduced grant this workflow's job
declares; the downgrade rule governs the token a called workflow
receives, not a string handed to it as a named secret. GitHub's
reusable-workflow documentation shows this exact pattern — a
caller job declaring `pull-requests: write` and passing
`${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` on to the called workflow — which
would serve no purpose if the hand-off dropped the grant. The
reasoning holds, but no run has confirmed it for this scope yet
(§13.5). It fails closed if wrong: the CLI rejects the token and
the step fails with the evidence bundle intact.

The default model is **`claude-sonnet-5`**. The CLI's own default,
`claude-sonnet-4.6`, retires from Copilot Business and Enterprise
on 2026-09-01, so the engine pins the successor explicitly rather
than inheriting a default about to disappear. The `model` input
overrides it per run.

### 13.4 Work items

Delivered: the `copilot` engine value, its credential guard and
model default, the tool-surface restriction plus the
allow/deny translation of the shared tool grants, the pinned CLI
install, session evidence into the artefact bundle, and the
`copilot` choice on the manual dry-run dispatch and the scheduled
caller's dispatch. Scheduled runs take the Copilot engine
(§13.6). The reusable workflow refuses a live run on this
engine, and down-scopes its App token to `issues: read`, so a
Copilot session holds no write-capable credential until the
enforcement below lands. Down-scoped rather than absent, because
the scan needs the App's org-wide reach: `github.token` is
repository-scoped, and a Copilot run without an App token would
see no repository but its own. Both guards live in the reusable
workflow rather than the caller, so every consumer inherits
them.

Remaining:

1. **Precondition for live use** — command-level enforcement: a
   `preToolUse` hook vetting each proposed shell command against
   the commands the policy names. It closes two gaps in §13.2,
   not one: the auto-approved reads, and the deny rules that
   flag placement walks past. Needs the hook payload contract
   confirmed against a real session before it goes anywhere near
   a security boundary. Half of the alternative once floated
   here — keeping the credential out of the agent's shell — has
   landed as the seeded `gh` configuration directory (§13.2),
   though §13.2 also records why that buys less than it looks
   like; the remaining half is vetting the commands themselves
2. **Second precondition for live use** — a route to the label
   wrapper. The CLI approves shell commands on their first-level
   stem, so `shell(bash triage-assets/scripts/apply-label.sh:*)`
   matches nothing, and the workable grant would be bare `bash`.
   A run confirmed the fix: install the wrapper as an executable
   on `PATH` under its own name, which `shell(<name>:*)` then
   grants and nothing more
3. Cost telemetry: `load_transcript_stats` parses a Claude-shaped
   execution log; map the Copilot CLI's log fields so the report
   carries turns and spend for this engine too (defensive parsing
   means unmapped fields drop out rather than break the report)
4. Replace the fine-grained PAT with a dedicated GitHub App
   (§13.6). Two questions gate it. First, verify that the CLI
   accepts an App installation token at all: its documented
   token list omits them (§13.3), so the whole route may not
   exist. Second, even if it does,
   `create-github-app-token` exposes no
   `permission-copilot-requests` input at any released version
   or on `main`, so the token needs a hand-rolled mint or an
   upstream contribution to that action. Neither question
   touches the App's repository-access tokens
5. Egress: an audit-mode Copilot run to harvest endpoints
   (`api.githubcopilot.com:443` and `registry.npmjs.org:443`
   expected, plus the Node distribution host used by
   `setup-node`) for the org allow-list, as §7.1 did for
   Anthropic. A first audit run recorded `api.github.com:443`,
   `github.com:443` and `registry.npmjs.org:443`; the Copilot
   backend itself has yet to appear, because that run failed
   authentication before reaching it

### 13.5 Open questions (Copilot track)

1. **The caller `GITHUB_TOKEN` route** — confirm that a token
   passed in as a named secret reaches the CLI carrying the
   caller job's `copilot-requests: write` grant (§13.3). Blocked
   behind the linting gate, so the PAT route carries the engine
   until then.
2. **Model choice** — `claude-sonnet-5` against
   `claude-haiku-4.5` for what is a classification workload;
   measure quality against cost on a real backlog.
3. **Premium-request accounting** — whether per-request billing
   makes retriage runs materially more expensive here than on the
   metered API engines, and where the analogue of a per-workspace
   spend cap lives (cost centres, per §13.3).

Settled by rehearsal runs against CLI 1.0.80:

- **Shell pattern matching** — approval happens on the
  first-level subcommand; denial matches the whole command. See
  §13.2.
- **Folder trust** — `-p` mode starts without asking, on an
  empty `COPILOT_HOME` and an untrusted working directory alike.
  No stall.

### 13.6 The scheduled engine and its identity

**Status:** decided for the engine, open for the identity.

Scheduled runs move from Claude to Copilot. The organisation
already pays for Copilot, so triage spend becomes an existing
entitlement rather than a third vendor relationship, and the
pipeline stops depending on a long-lived model API key.

That choice carries a cost worth stating plainly: **the schedule
cannot label anything until §13.4 items 1 and 2 land.** The
reusable workflow refuses live runs on this engine, so scheduled
triage reports proposals and applies nothing. Reverting the
schedule to `claude` is a one-line change if that proves too
long to wait.

#### Why a dedicated App rather than a shared one

The credential this pipeline runs on should be a GitHub App
created for this pipeline and nothing else. Not a personal
access token, and not an existing organisation bot.

A PAT fails on three counts. It ties an organisation-wide
scheduled job to one person's continued employment, seat and
attention. It expires — a 30-day token means the schedule breaks
in 30 days, without warning, on a weekday morning. And it bills
premium requests to that person rather than the organisation.

Reusing an existing bot fails differently, and worse over time. A
shared identity accumulates permissions as each new consumer
asks for one more, and no consumer ever asks for one fewer. The
result is a credential whose blast radius is the union of every
use case that ever touched it, which is precisely what a
leaked-token incident then costs. A single-purpose App keeps the
blast radius equal to the job: propose and apply issue labels,
and make Copilot requests.

#### Shape

The repository-access half holds up. One App, minting a token
per role:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

| Role | Permission | Minted for | Reaches |
| ---- | ---------- | ---------- | ------- |
| Reading | `issues: read` | every engine's scan, as `GH_TOKEN` | issues across the target organisation |
| Labelling | `issues: write` | engines that can label, as `GH_TOKEN` | issues in the target organisation |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

The model-access half does **not**, though an earlier revision of
this section claimed otherwise. The idea was a third token from
the
same App, carrying `copilot_requests: write` and reaching the
Copilot backend plus the `metadata: read` every installation
token holds. That would be the strongest credential here — no
person, no expiry outage, no stored PAT — and it may yet work.
But see §13.3: the CLI's documented token list omits
installation tokens, the GitHub page describing them covers the
SDK rather than the CLI, and no run has tested one against
1.0.80. Treat it as a candidate to verify, not a design to build
against.

Verifying it costs one App and one dispatch: mint a token with
`copilot_requests: write`, put it in `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, run
the engine. It fails closed — the CLI rejects the token and the
step fails with the evidence bundle intact — so the experiment is
cheap and safe. Until someone runs it, the PAT carries this
engine.

One alternative sits inside the CLI's documented list and
deserves weighing if the installation token does not work: an
OAuth token from a GitHub App acting **for a user** (`ghu_`).
That keeps the App identity but reintroduces a person, and needs
refresh-token handling that an unattended schedule has nowhere
good to keep. It trades the problem rather than solving it.

Minting one token per role from one App keeps the separation
§13.3 requires — neither credential can do the other's job —
while leaving one identity to audit, one installation to review,
and one private key to rotate. All expire in an hour.

One caveat, and it applies to the unverified model half alone:
GitHub's server-to-server documentation says the Copilot
permission check requires the installation to hold **All
repositories** access. That is broader than this pipeline needs.
The `issues` tokens stay scoped by `repository_ids` regardless,
so the breadth would attach to the model credential — which
reaches no issue data, but does carry the metadata read every
installation token holds.

#### Blocker

Even once verified, minting the model token needs tooling that
does not exist yet. `actions/create-github-app-token` exposes no
`permission-copilot-requests` input — not at v3.2.0, not at any
later release, not on `main`. A generator produces its permission
inputs, so this is a lag rather than a refusal. Until it catches
up the options are a hand-rolled mint (App JWT, then
`POST /app/installations/{id}/access_tokens` with
`{"permissions": {"copilot_requests": "write"}}`) or a
contribution upstream. A hand-rolled mint inside a security
boundary deserves more care than a pinned action does, which
argues for the contribution — and argues for settling the
verification question first, before anyone writes either.

The repository-access tokens have no such blocker:
`permission-issues` already exists and the workflow uses it.
