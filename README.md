Scheduled AI triage of GitHub issues. A reusable workflow scans an
organisation's open issues, runs an agent session — **Claude Code,
the Gemini CLI, or the GitHub Copilot CLI**, selected per run —
that applies category labels per a versioned policy prompt, and
attaches full run evidence to the workflow run: before/after
snapshots, engine-specific session evidence (Claude: a
turn-by-turn transcript; Gemini: telemetry plus the session
summary, with transcript fidelity under verification — design doc
§12; Copilot: CLI logs plus the shared session transcript), and a
diff-based report.

## 📚 Documentation

<https://lfreleng-actions.github.io/github-issues-triage/>

Per-engine setup — credentials, permissions, and the checks that
prove them — lives in [`docs/setup/`](docs/setup/README.md). The
[design document](docs/development/DESIGN.md) covers the
architecture, containment model, and rollout plan in full.

## How it works

```text
snapshot (before) -> agent session -> snapshot (after)
                                        -> diff -> report + summary
```

1. Capture the organisation's open-issue state as JSON
2. Skip the agent session when zero unlabelled issues exist
3. Run the selected engine with read/label `gh` verbs and a policy
   prompt ([`prompt/triage.md`](prompt/triage.md))
4. Capture the state again, diff, and report observed label
   movement — never the agent's own claims — to the step summary
5. Upload the artefact bundle (snapshots, transcript, prompt,
   report) with 90-day retention, even when the session fails

## Consuming the reusable workflow

Other organisations and users can call the pipeline directly,
supplying their own tokens:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```yaml
jobs:
  triage:
    permissions:
      # Snapshot reads; label writes use the App token instead
      issues: read
      contents: read
    # Pin to an immutable release commit SHA; the tag rides along
    # as a comment. Never reference a mutable branch here: the
    # workflow receives your API key and an issues:write token.
    # yamllint disable-line rule:line-length
    uses: lfreleng-actions/github-issues-triage/.github/workflows/issues-triage.yaml@<commit-sha>  # vX.Y.Z
    with:
      org: 'your-org'
      dry_run: true
      github_app_client_id: ${{ vars.YOUR_APP_CLIENT_ID }}
    secrets:
      anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
      github_app_private_key: ${{ secrets.YOUR_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Pinning the workflow pins its scripts and prompt too: the assets
checkout defaults to the called workflow's own commit.

### Using the Copilot engine

> [!WARNING]
> The Copilot engine holds a weaker containment boundary than the

> never applies labels: pairing it with `dry_run: false` fails
> the run before the session starts.

The `copilot` engine needs no model API key. Grant the calling
job `copilot-requests: write` and hand its `GITHUB_TOKEN` to the
pipeline; usage meters to the organisation, gated on the "Allow
use of Copilot CLI billed to the organization" policy.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```yaml
jobs:
  triage:
    permissions:
      issues: read
      contents: read
      # Authorises Copilot model requests; carries no repository
      # access of its own.
      copilot-requests: write
    # yamllint disable-line rule:line-length
    uses: lfreleng-actions/github-issues-triage/.github/workflows/issues-triage.yaml@<commit-sha>  # vX.Y.Z
    with:
      org: 'your-org'
      engine: 'copilot'
      dry_run: true
    secrets:
      copilot_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Where that policy is unavailable, pass a fine-grained PAT holding
the "Copilot Requests" permission as `copilot_token` instead and
drop the `copilot-requests` grant. Both routes, with their
trade-offs, are in
[docs/setup/GITHUB.md](docs/setup/GITHUB.md).

Labels travel over a repository-access token, and the Copilot
credential is never that same token. What else the model
credential can reach depends on the route. A PAT scoped to
Copilot Requests reaches nothing but the model. The caller
`GITHUB_TOKEN` carries whatever the calling job grants —
`issues: read` and `contents: read` in the example above — so
grant that job reads alone, or the model credential becomes
write-capable too.

The reusable workflow does not declare `copilot-requests` itself:
a called workflow can narrow the caller's permissions but never
widen them, so declaring it there would fail every caller that
runs a different engine. Passing the token in as a secret leaves
that decision with you. Design doc §13.3 covers the reasoning, and
§13.5 records that no run has yet confirmed the grant survives the
hand-off — if it does not, the CLI rejects the token and the step
fails with the evidence bundle intact.

Without a GitHub App the pipeline cannot write: dry-run reports
work with the caller's `github.token` (`issues: read`), and live
runs refuse to start. Applying labels needs an App installed
across the target with `issues: write` and `metadata: read`;
single-repository runs scope the App token to that repository at
mint time. The `copilot` engine takes the same App token at
`issues: read`, which keeps its scan organisation-wide while
leaving it unable to label.

## Safety model

- **Dry-run by default**: consumers opt in to live labelling
- **Tool containment**: the agent receives read verbs of `gh` plus,
  in live mode, a constrained wrapper that validates repository,
  issue number, and label existence before a fixed `--add-label`
  operation — no `gh issue edit`, no `git`, no arbitrary shell
- **Copilot engine caveat**: that engine restricts the model to
  shell tools, denies the mutating `gh` and `git` verbs, turns
  off built-in MCP servers and custom-instruction loading, and
  keeps both credentials out of the agent's own environment by
  seeding a `gh` configuration directory instead. Its allow-list
  is an approval policy rather than a filter, though, and the CLI
  keeps auto-approving shell commands it treats as reads. Those
  commands run unsandboxed as the same user, so one can reach the
  configuration file, or the CLI's own environment a process up.
  Value-based redaction is what protects the token there, and a
  command that encodes the value defeats it. Writes stay shut,
  and the workflow refuses live runs on this engine until the
  enforcement in design doc §13.4 lands
- **Token scope**: App tokens carry `metadata: read` plus
  `issues: write`, or `issues: read` on the `copilot` engine,
  which cannot label. Down-scoped at mint time, expiring in an
  hour. The model credential is never the *repository-access*
  token this pipeline mints: the Anthropic and Gemini keys carry
  no GitHub permissions at all, and a Copilot PAT scoped to
  Copilot Requests reaches nothing but the model.
  The Copilot route that reuses a caller `GITHUB_TOKEN` carries
  whatever that job grants, so grant such a job reads alone
- **Prompt-injection defence**: the policy prompt instructs the
  agent to treat issue text as data; containment limits the worst
  case to a wrong label
- **Egress control**: harden-runner in audit or block mode, with
  the allow-list loaded from a tagged org baseline

## Development

Run the linting suite before pushing:

```bash
uvx pre-commit run --all-files
```

Build and preview the documentation site locally:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.13
uv pip install --require-hashes --requirement docs/requirements.txt
.venv/bin/mkdocs serve
```

The report generator has a strict type-checking gate
(`basedpyright`, see `pyproject.toml`) and the prompt document
passes the same prose linting as the rest of the repository.
